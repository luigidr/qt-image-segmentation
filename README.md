## Lab 6 - Image Segmentation

*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) - academic year 2012-2013*

A project, made in Qt Creator, for playing with edge detection, erosion and dilatation. The project uses OpenCV 2.4.3 and performs image segmentation upon a webcam video stream.

Before using such a project, you must open its `.pro` files and edit the path to the OpenCV library, which should be already installed on your computer.
